# BoticÃ¡rio's Desenvolve Program Challenge Solution

This repository contains my solution to the challenge from [BoticÃ¡rio's Desenvolve Program](https://desenvolve.grupoboticario.com.br/).

## Challenge: Creating the page footer

The challenge was to create the `<main>` and `<footer>` sections of a webpage following the instructions provided on [Notion](https://milenaemmert.notion.site/Desafio-Criando-o-Footer-da-p-gina-a87c70459fb942aba9b62cc952a17128).

To view the solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/desenvolve-fullstack.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

No additional setup or dependencies are required for this solution, as it is built using only HTML and CSS.

Share your results with your colleagues and happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’•
